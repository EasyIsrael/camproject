Welcome to Camproject's documentation!
===================================

**Camproject** is a Python library for camera projections and reprojections. 
If you take a photo of a scene and you know the coordinates and orientation of the camera you can calculate the pixel position from a 3D scene object (projection) or - if you know the distance between camera and 3D scene object - you can invert this process and calculate the 3D coordinates from the pixel position (reprojection).

Check out the :doc:`introduction` section for further information. :doc:`quickstart` gives you the most important commands to work with this library.
